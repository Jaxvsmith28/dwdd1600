        <h1>History</h1>
        <h2>The Ancient Beginnings</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Hand tools & early shaping</h3>In ancient times, artisans used chisels, files, and bow drills to shape wood and soft metals.</li>
            <li><h3>The Lathe (~1300 BC)</h3>One of the earliest machine tools, the two-person lathe, allowed people to rotate a workpiece while cutting it, laying the groundwork for turning operations.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>19th Century: Machine Tool Boom</h2>
         <ul>
            <li><h3>Rise of milling, planers, and shapers</h3>The 1800s saw a surge in machine tool development. Milling machines enabled precise cutting of flat surfaces, slots, and gears. Planers and shapers were used to create large, flat surfaces.</li>
            <li><h3>Standardization & precision</h3>Engineers like Henry Maudslay and Joseph Whitworth advanced precision engineering with screw-cutting lathes and measurement standards, making interchangeable parts possible.</li>
            <li><h3>Industrial growth</h3>Machine shops became critical to railroads, steam engines, and weapon production.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Early 20th Century: Power & Automation</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Electric motors</h3>Electric motors replaced overhead line shafts, improving safety and flexibility in factories.</li>
            <li><h3>Tool material advances</h3>high-speed steel and later carbide allowed cutting harder metals at faster speeds.</li>
            <li><h3>More sophisticated machines</h3>Machines grew, incorporating hydraulic and early electric controls, paving the way for semi-automated processes.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Post-WWII: NC & CNC revolution</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Numerical Control (NC)</h3>Numerical control emerged in the late 1940s and 1950s, using punched tape to control machine motions automatically.</li>
            <li><h3>Computer Numerical Control (CNC)</h3>CNC replaced tapes with digital computers in the 1970s, vastly improving flexibility, repeatability, and the ability to machine complex 3D shapes.</li>
            <li><h3>Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) software</h3>CAM began to integrate with design, automating the transition from CAD (Computer-Aided Design) models to machine instructions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Today: High-Tech Machining</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Multi-axis CNC machines (5+ axes)</h3>Multi-axis machines handle complex parts with fewer setups, increasing efficiency and precision.</li>
            <li><h3>Advanced cutting tools</h3>Coated carbide, ceramics, PCD tackle tough alloys and composites.</li>
            <li><h3>Hybrid Manufacturing</h3>Hybrid manufacturing combines metal 3D printing and CNC machining to make intricate parts.</li>
            <li><h3>Industry 4.0 & smart machining</h3>Sensors, data analytics, and automation let machines monitor and optimize cutting in real-time, while robotic systems handle loading and quality checks.</li>
        </ul>
